# Robot Arm 

### goal/planning

The goal of this project was to create a robot arm of our choice. We chose to create two, one arm(the control arm) and the main arm.
The purpose of the control arm was to be able to freely move with those movements being mirrored onto the main arm.

This is an image of our first sketch of the idea where the main arm is on the left anbd the control arm is on the right.

### test 

Cad
### description
this cad was to make the 2 different arms controlled and one would mirror the other.
it took a long time to import and create all the specialized parts for this project.

### Reflection
this cad was difficult beacuse of the many changes we made and then having to change everything.
we needed to have a more set design and plan before starting to make a onshape design beacuse it just took longer.
having to change little things like the length of the base caused way more pain then they had to if I had spent more time on constraints.
the key to this project was the bottom servo spinning the top plate which only worked because of the 2mm indent into the side of the base where the spinning top would sit and not get stuck.
additionally having the support for the servo on the top worked well and made it have easier rotations.
