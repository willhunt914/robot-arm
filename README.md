# Robot Arm 

### goal/planning

The goal of this project was to create a robot arm of our choice. We chose to create two, one arm(the control arm) and the main arm.
The purpose of the control arm was to be able to freely move with those movements being mirrored onto the main arm.

This is an image of our first sketch of the idea where the main arm is on the left anbd the control arm is on the right.
